## Troubleshooting

### Install Button Doesn't Appear

**Possible Reasons:**
1. Already installed (check if app is in standalone mode)
2. Not served over HTTPS (required except localhost)
3. Manifest.json not found (check browser console)
4. Service worker registration failed (check console)

**Solutions:**
- Check DevTools > Application > Manifest
- Check DevTools > Application > Service Workers
- Clear site data and reload

### iOS Install Not Working

**Requirements:**
- Must use Safari browser
- Must be served over HTTPS
- Manifest must be valid

**Note:** iOS doesn't show automatic install prompts. Users must:
1. Tap Share button
2. Tap "Add to Home Screen"

### Offline Mode Not Working

**Check:**
- Service worker registered (DevTools > Application)
- Resources cached (DevTools > Application > Cache Storage)
- Network requests (DevTools > Network tab)

**Fix:**
```bash
# Clear cache and rebuild
rm -rf .next
npm run build
npm start
```

## Next Steps

### Recommended Enhancements
