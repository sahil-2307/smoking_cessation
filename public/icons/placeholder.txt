# PWA Icons Needed

Create these icon sizes with a green "Q" logo:
- icon-144x144.png
- icon-192x192.png

For now, you can:
1. Open create-icon.html in a browser to generate icons
2. Or temporarily disable PWA by commenting out the withPWA wrapper in next.config.js

The authentication flow should work without icons.
