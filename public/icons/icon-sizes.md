# PWA Icons Required

To complete the PWA setup, you need to add these icon files to `/public/icons/`:

## Required Icon Sizes:
- icon-72x72.png
- icon-96x96.png
- icon-128x128.png
- icon-144x144.png
- icon-152x152.png
- icon-192x192.png
- icon-384x384.png
- icon-512x512.png

## How to Create Icons:
1. Create a base icon (512x512px) with:
   - QuitSmoking logo/symbol
   - Green color scheme (#22c55e)
   - Clear, readable design

2. Use an online tool like:
   - https://realfavicongenerator.net/
   - https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
   - https://favicon.io/

3. Or use design tools like Figma/Canva to resize

## Temporary Solution:
For now, the manifest.json references these icons but they return 404.
The app will still work, but won't be installable until icons are added.

## Icon Design Suggestions:
- Use a leaf or health symbol üçÉ
- Include "Q" for QuitSmoking
- Green/white color scheme
- Simple, recognizable design
- Works well at small sizes
